**Using data to create an ecosystem that helps diabetic patients to live healthier
**

Diabetes is not anything new; we've been living with it for ages now since ancient Egyptians first discovered it over 3000 years ago[1].  Although we know a lot about diabetes, the most obvious fact is that everything will change the day it enters your life, and nothing will be the same.

Diabetes has asymptomatic at the beginning, which is why millions of people don't know they have it [2]. That's why high blood sugar and high levels of insulin will start to slowly damage your body before you even notice that you have the disease [2]. Once diagnosed, you may find yourself facing severe complications that cannot be neglected. 
Diabetes global stats 2021
According to International Diabetes Federation, in 2021, we had 537 million adults live with diabetes - 1 in 10 [3].  And we're expecting that we'll have 643 million diabetic patients by 2030 [3].
Diabetes -alone- was the cause for 6.7 million deaths in 2021 - 1 every 5 seconds [3].
Not only that, but the IDF reported that 541 million adults already have Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT), which makes them highly susceptible to type 2 diabetes [3].
Doctors and diabetic educators don't have enough time
Living with diabetes is not easy, and there are so many things we need to consider to keep ourselves on the safe side, which can be very stressful to manage, but we have to deal with it, and we shouldn't put our lives on hold when we get the disease.  However, the odds are good that you can live a long, healthy life with diabetes if you manage to give part of your attention to the details of your daily habits. 

The main building block of living well with diabetes is data - with data, we'll have what we need to optimize the lifestyle to deal in the best possible way with the situation.  Diabetes data, however, can be inconvenient to collect, hard to analyze, and often downright overwhelming [4].  That's why most diabetic patients seek help from doctors and diabetes educators who don't have time to dig deeper into each patient's data.  As a result, we end up providing those patients with a relatively superficial guide.

How technology plays a vital role to help diabetic patients
From insulin pens and glucometers to a variety of mobile apps, there are a lot of apps and technology to help patients better deal with the disease, and they can be divided into three categories.

1- Taking insulin technology
Most diabetic patients rely on insulin in their daily routine.  Insulin pens used to be the most common way to take it.  However, we're seeing new products like insulin pumps and smart insulin pens that make this obligatory habit easier [5]. 

2- Checking blood glucose technology
Once you have diabetes, you'll start putting part of your daily focus on your blood sugar level and make sure you keep it at target levels to avoid any unwanted complications.  There are a variety of glucometers to perform the function of measuring your glucose level at home.  In addition, newer technology was introduced, like CGM, Flash, and smart monitors [5] [7]. 

3- Manage diabetes technology
In the last couple of years, we've seen a lot of mobile apps that help patients to manage their entire diabetes-related life.  Examples are Bezzy T2D, MySugr, Glucose Buddy, and others [5] [7].
Top available features in diabetes control apps
With the many application available in the diabetes ecosystem, diabetic patients can now get many features to accompany them in their long-life journey with the disease.  The ideal scenario is one app that stores your diabetes data from the various connected devices, integrations, and manual entries.  Then, this app will be like your control tower, giving you any needed information in a click and suggesting what to do next to stay healthy with diabetes.

1- All diabetes data in one place
When it comes to diabetes data, the first thing we'll need is to gather all possible data points in one place. mySugr app provides this under its Logging feature. Through the app, you'll be able to log important therapy data such as blood sugar, meals, activity, insulin, and so much more!
This feature will ease accessibility and get back to match important events that happened in a specific period to the diabetic measures during that period, which will lead to more data-driven decisions by the therapist and diabetic educators. [7]
2- Get diabetes devices connected
The second step in building the ecosystem is to get all of your devices connected to this app. This connection will automatically log your diabetes data, like your blood sugar levels, directly into the app, no more manual work. Think of it as your new diabetic smartwatch. You can also connect your Google Fit® or Apple Health® tracker to track your fitness data as well. You'll find applications like mySugr and Glucose Buddy that provide this feature. [6] [7]
3- Analyze data gathered from different data points
Now we have everything gathered in one place, we need to know what those numbers mean. Many applications provide a dashboard for diabetic patients with analysis of the collected data points in a specific timeframe. As a result, the patient will better know his situation, compare days and weeks data to see the progress over time, and take action on their daily habits and diabetic management practice accordingly based on this data. [7]

4- Calculating estimated HbA1c
Once the app gets enough data points about the blood glucose values, it will be able to estimate HbA1c data for patients anytime, making no room for surprises; you'll know the estimations whenever you want to see how you can react to them.
mySugr also has this feature. All you have to do is to log your blood sugar levels three times a day for seven days, and the app will calculate the estimated HbA1c (eHb1Ac). [7]
Importance of data in delivering a personalized service within the diabetes ecosystem
All of the features mentioned in this blog and many other features won't be here without the power of data. By having data about the patient's diet, fitness, glucose levels, and many other diabetes-related measures, we can connect patients to other services closing the ecosystem loop. For example, we can create a marketplace inside the app with tailored offers based on the current measures. We can also connect patients with diabetic educators or therapists based on geographic location or personal preferences; any data point collected within those apps helps make diabetes more manageable in the era of digital health.
